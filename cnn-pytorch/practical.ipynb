    "This is an [Oxford Visual Geometry Group](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg) computer vision practical, authored by [Andrea Vedaldi](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vedaldi/) and Andrew Zisserman (Release 2018a).\n",

    "*Convolutional neural networks* are an important class of learnable representation applicable, amongst others, to numerous computer vision problems. Deep CNNs, in particular, are composed of several layers of processing, each involving linear as well as non-linear operators, that are learned jointly, in an end-to-end manner, to solve a particular task. These methods are now the dominant approach for feature extraction from audiovisual and textual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This practical explores the basics of learning (deep) CNNs. The first part introduces typical CNN building blocks, such as ReLU units and linear filters, with a particular emphasis on understanding back-propagation. The second part looks at learning two basic CNNs. The first one is a simple non-linear filter capturing particular image structures, while the second one is a network that recognises typewritten characters (using a variety of different fonts). These examples illustrate the use of stochastic gradient descent with momentum, the definition of an objective function, the construction of mini-batches of data, and data jittering. The last part shows how powerful CNN models can be downloaded off-the-shelf and used directly in applications, bypassing the expensive training process.\n",

Formally, each $\\bx_i$ will be a $N\\times C \\times U_1 \\times U_2$ real array of $U_1 \\times U_2$ pixels and $C$ channels per pixel representing $N$ data samples. Hence the first dimension of the array spans data samples, the second spans feature channels and the last two span space width and height, respectively.
