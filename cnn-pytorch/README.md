Convolutional neural network practical (PyTorch version)
========================================================

A computer vision practical by the Oxford Visual Geometry group,
authored by Andrea Vedaldi and Andrew Zisserman.

Running the practical on your local machine
-------------------------------------------

*   Install the appropriate PyTorch environment. The easiest way is to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) or [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) and then crate the environment `practical` using the provided `pratical.yaml` configuration file, as follows:

        conda env create -f practical.yaml

    This step needs to be run only once.

*   Activate the PyTorch environment for the current session:

        conda activate practical

*   Run the pratical

        jupyter notebook practical.yaml

Appendix: Installing from scratch
---------------------------------

*   Install and setup PyTorch as explained above.

*   For **developers**, it is also recommended to install the `nbstripout` command:
        
        nbstripout --install

    In this manner Git can strip the output data from the iPython notebook before checking in.

*   For bootstrapping the data for the practical follow these steps:

        cd practical-directory
        mkdir -p data                    # Make the data/ directory
        cp extra/cover.png data/         # Copy the practical cover image
        ./extra/genfonts.sh              # Download the Google Fonts to ./extra/fonts
        ./extra/genstring.sh             # Create data/sentence-lato.png
        python3 -m extra.pack_fonts      # Create data/charsdb.pth
        python3 -m extra.pretrain_models # Create data/model*.pth and data/alexnet.pth


Package contents
----------------

The practical consist of a iPython notebook and a supporting file:

* `practical.ipynb` -- The Python Jupyter practical
* `lab.py` -- Supporting Python code

The distribution also ships with some data and maintenance code.

Appendix: Installing from scratch
---------------------------------

The practical requires both VLFeat and MatConvNet. VLFeat comes with
pre-built binaries, but MatConvNet does not.

1. Set the current directory to the practical base directory.
2. Install the Conda environment as explained above, then activate it with
   `conda activate practical`.
2. Run `./extra/genfonts.sh`. This will download the Google Fonts
  and extract them as PNG files in `./extra/fonts`.
3. Run `./extra/genstring.sh`. This will create
  `data/sentence-lato.png`.
4. Run `python -m extra.pack_fonts`. This will create `data/charsdb.pth`.
5. Run `python -m extra.pretrain_models`. This will create `data/model*.pth` and `data/alexnet.pth`.

For developers, it is also recommended to install the `nbstripout` command 
in git using `nbstripout --install`.

Changes
-------

* *2018a* - PyTorch version.
* *2017a* - Removes dependency on VLFeat and upgrades MatConvNet.
* *2015a* - Initial edition.
