Object detection
================

Learn to detect objects such as pedestrian, cars, traffic signs, in an
image.  The challenge is to not only recognize but also localize
objects in images, as well as to enumerate their occurrences,
regardless changes in location, scale, illumination, articulation, and
many other factors.  The practical covers using HOG features to
describe image regions, building a sliding-window SVM object detector,
operating at multiple scales, evaluating a detector using average
precision, and improving it using hard negative mining.
