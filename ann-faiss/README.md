### Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) Methods

This short practical focuses on different Approximate Nearest
Neighbour (ANN) methods, which are used for search and retrieval
systems that handle high-dimensional data such as images and sound.
The practical covers Product Quantization (PQ) and Vector Quantization
(VQ), and allows experimenting with different trade-offs of memory,
speed, and search accuracy.
